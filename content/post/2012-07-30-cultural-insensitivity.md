I'm glad my culture of[ 5700 years][1] has been reduced to 'good moneymaking'.  After all, I'm sure the Moses, as he descended from the mount had a marketing plan to sell little [Torah][1]s all over, because he was [culturally attuned][2].

I can hear  the clang of symbols as my [ancestors fled Egypt][3] making sure they stowed the gold on their way out of the country.

Throughout the centuries[ Jews have been derided for their attentiveness to money][4] and things money, often imbued with powers never given them to control monies.  [Shylock][1], that most derided of Shakesperian characters is but one of many.

Mr Romney, do you not hear the [hoofbeats of history][5]?    When you suggest that the Jewish people culturally are attuned to moneymaking did you disconnect from our recent history?  The[ images of Jews and money][6] and [world domination][7] flooded German newspapers, particularly [de Sturmer][8].

I understand the rush for votes.  I also understand that history is less forgiving than we thought. Apparently we are slow to learn those lessons. ["Those who cannot remember the past, are condemned to repeat it." ][9]
