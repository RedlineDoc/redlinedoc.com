We seem, in the US, to have come to love our [Tzars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar). To be sure the Russian's also loved their Tzars, to death.

Why is it then that we love them so? We have a [car Czar][1], a [Drug Tzar][2]. Czar this and Tzar that. Its the same intellect that brought back 'crusades'. Perhaps the most monstrous human losses were suffered in the crusades expeditions from West to East, jihads of an earlier time, most all doomed to failure.

So, why Czars?. The Russian's loved their Czars, hated them and in the end they killed not only the Czar but his children, childrens children, household workers, horses and anyone who could pronounce the name. So why are WE in love with Czar's for drugs and Czars for cars?  Given the mounting success of the war on drugs (actually a war on the American people, but more of that later) and the apparent success of the Car Czar (bankruptcy of the two of the three major US car manufacturers), we seem to be approaching the Russian ideal.

I'm old enough to remember [Nikita Khruschev][3]

![Nikita Khrushchev pounding his shoe at the UN](http://www.deceptively-simple.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/khrushchev_shoe1.jpg) 

declaring they (USSR at the time) would bury US. (yes yes its double entendre).  We recognized at once the value of shoe pounding and within a few years here we are, appointing Czars.

The [Jews of the Pale][4], knew well that the Czar was no friend but as with all things they had blessings for everything.  Teyve in [Fiddler on the Roof][5] coughs up a [blessing][6], "God bless and keep the tzar -- far away from us!"  Indeed.

As of old, Czars were not elected, nor even chosen by some lady emerging from the lake with a flaming sword, but chosen. We insulate them from possible rational commentary.  New sources flock to them for information. As of old, they stand apart.
