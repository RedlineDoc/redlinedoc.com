          <p>How did we allow the discussion to move away from health to how we should save the health insurance industry? How did that conversation move from a public healthy option to saving the profits of some of the most profitable companies in the world?
As there is increasing talk in Washington about the AMA  time clicks by. And to whom are the insurance companies responsible? Ahhh shareholders, the same folks who brought us the current bank debacle, to whom we the people pay extravagant sums so that they can support CEO&rsquo;s in a style to which they&rsquo;d like to become accustomed.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve had a catbird seat for the construction of a new facility in the poor end of town where I work. Its a marvel of glass and concrete and steel and glass &ndash; oh I DID say glass. Indeed the glass rises nearly spire like to the roof at the front of this building. Wing like, the roof soars. It is a beauty to behold. One of the many problems, probably not foreseen on this ancient floodplain of a building site, is that water needs to go somewhere.</p>

          <p>Dr Dave Janda writes &ldquo;The underlying method of cutting costs throughout the plan is based on rationing and denying care. There is no focus on preventing health care need whatever. The plan&rsquo;s method is the most inhumane and unethical approach to cutting costs I can imagine as a physician.&rdquo; It is true that some rationing of care will ensue from any medical plan; however, the draconian results predicted by Dr Janda, Translation .</p>

          <p>Its sometimes a sad view, a view of contrasts, a view of contradictions, a view of humanity. I look out into the swirl of mad colors, through the colors of people, through the colors of spring turned summer, through the bright signs to the monochrome lives of the poor on our block.

          <p>I found myself unaccountably angry at statements from the auto manufacturers the other day. The mouth of Sauron from Chrysler tells us that to save money and jobs (and get a handout from Uncle Sam), that they&rsquo;re dropping several lines, among them the PT Cruiser. Not much new. One of the reasons they&rsquo;re dropping the cruiser is that they put a bad engine in the thing; but it sold. So what!</p>

          <p>I was driving home this evening listening to the discussion about why the financial institutions are putting out the same hybrid products that brought us this wonderful recession, hearing the pundits explain that it brings capital into the markets and although its a bit (a bit?) risky, these instruments help to drive the market. Ok. I&rsquo;m no financial whiz but didn&rsquo;t we just loan billions and trillions of dollars to these self serving financial institutions to NOT have them bet the store?</p>

          <p>Strange you say. Governor Rell (I&rsquo;m a yankee) just vetoed Sustinet. Sustinet? Sustinet was a plan to insure every citizen in Connecticut starting with the most vulnerable, including state employees and rolling in small businesses and non-profits to make a large coverage group competing with private insurance companies for benefits and coverages. No one would be forced to enter Sustinet (other than the current state medicaid/safetynet and employees) and it would have to stand on its own merit.</p>

          <p>That line from the movie &ldquo;Dave&rdquo; would be poignant if it were not so sad here . Most of the people I see want to work &ndash; but there is no work. &ldquo;Work was something that used to exist&rdquo; &ndash; Jean Sheppard &ndash; and he was talking about the &ldquo;Great Depression&rdquo;. Alas it was neither great nor did we learn from it. But I digress.
Yesterday one of my patients arrived all smiles and cheery; yes.</p>

          <p>Today we buried a cat. Not just a cat but a family cat of 14+ years. She came to us as a small fur bundle, not a handful, not eyes open yet, abandoned mewling. We tiger milk fed her with noises from the kids about what a pain she was .. .
And she became ours. She was first and foremost my daughter Shelley&rsquo;s cat, sleeping with her, cuddling with her being her special friend through out her teen years.</p>

          <p>It seems its a day of good news bad news. The good news seems to be that the boys at Goldman Sachs are snuffling at the trough and ready to suck up those great well deserved bonuses for having put us in the worst recession since the 30&rsquo;s perhaps worse than that. I fear that we missed an opportunity for heads on pikes. I&rsquo;m not ordinarily a gory sort of fellow; however, if a few of those egregious folk had their heads up along the boulevard perhaps fewer of these guys would be snorting at the trough so soon.</p>
