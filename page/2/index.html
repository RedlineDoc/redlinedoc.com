          <p>Sorry for the long delay out there but there have been some connection problems as well as difficulties uploading photos to FLICKR so that they won&rsquo;t take up all the room in the world. Tuesday was clinic day at Pop-Wuj in the city. The line up for clinic is not unlike that at CHS.
As a clinician I tail around one of the local doctors, Dr. Christian. He works Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday&rsquo;s at the clinic and does a small wound clinic on Tuesday and Friday mornings.</p>

          <p>The big boys at Chrysler appear to have taken the pipe, 4 BILLION (with a &lsquo;B&rsquo; folks) in losses since exiting bankrupty! I doubt that will stop the executive piggies from snorting at the money trough in the name of needing to pay the best and brightest.
We need to remind ourselves that the Mouth of Sauron himself, the Chrysler damage control guy, at meetings this past year said &ldquo;Oh .</p>

          <p>As I read Paul Krugman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Looters in Loafers&rdquo;.i felt a bit prescient having blogged Bonuses for Bettors  before the current revelations. Perhaps that should be re-evaluations. Slippery as eels these folks, they fall back on &hellip; caveat emptor
&rdquo; although the only non-blinded fellows in the room were they. It was the impending release of poorJeffrey, once the smartest guy in the room, realizing there were more cats to be skinned, er I mean folks to be fleeced.</p>

          <p>They trek in. They trek out. They stop, rest, disgorge their fantastic stories and let us help them; then out they go into the real world again.
Alas were this some fantasmagoric game. Its not. Its a Community Health Center. We seem to collect them. Its partly our mission and partly our trial. The health system in the United States has some serious problems those in power have yet to appreciate the depth of the hole, as it were.</p>

          <p>Sad faces. Sad days. We see the poorest of the poor at myhealth center. Its a magnet for those who have nowhere else. We will see them. We do see them. We patch them up. We send them back into the fray, the madness that has become our world in the north end of Hartford, Connecticut, only miles from the richest squares of land in the country. The disparity is at once engaging and maddening.</p>

          <p>We often take for granted that people really understand technology. We recently installed a new computerized (well somewhat) Medical Record System in our workplace. It makes you go ..hmmm.
This past Friday a co-worker came to me waving a sheaf of papers. &ldquo;I did what you wanted. I put the orders in the system. I&rsquo;ve been waiting a month and nothing (emphasized with the sheaf of papers) shows up on the computer.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve been quiet again. Probably feeling a deep recession myself, much more moral than fiscal but none the less, staying away from vocalizing what should be said.
I awoke to a story this morning about Jeffrey Skilling. His lawyers want to revisit the case so poor Jeffrey, who ruined the lives not only of stockholders, but his fellow employees by lying and taking their monies would be set free. But I digress.</p>

          <p>It amazes me that in the land ofthe best healthcare we&rsquo;re more in the business of denying care than providing it.
I get a call the other day that a kid has stepped on a piece of glass. Its off hours but I say &ldquo;sure, bring him in, I&rsquo;ll take a look&rdquo;.
A pale frightened 13y/o arrives at the clinic with parents. Apparently yesterday he jumped up off a picnic table (in the way that 13 year old males do) and sprang directly onto a wine glass lying on the ground.</p>

          <p>My mind and my body shout “No, no its NEVER right never correct”. I was listening to NPR the other day regarding our coming to terms with torture. OUR coming to terms? That &ldquo;our&rdquo; is &ldquo;us&rdquo;, We the People&hellip;
I have this open ended discussion with my family about this. How is this &ldquo;us&rdquo;. How did We the People. .. become Us the torturers&hellip;. How is this ever right.
I think it comes from trimming a bit off the Constitution, that rather dusty rag of a document which our Founding Fathers found so important.</p>

          <p>Why can&rsquo;t we pay for health care for everyone? Why is it that is this country we have such a divide? Is it our puritanical upbringing which says work hard and you&rsquo;ll get your rewards?
Sadly folks, the Puritan&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t have it all that wonderfully. Life was hard but it was short. There were no antibiotics, no x-rays, no casts, no real surgery (with anesthesia). Hospitals were to be avoided as pest houses and physicians themselves at the time knew they did little for their patients.</p>
