      <description>&lt;p&gt;We often take for granted that people really understand technology.  We recently installed a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.himss.org/ASP/topics_ehr.asp&#34;&gt;computerized&lt;/a&gt; (well somewhat) Medical Record System in our workplace. It makes you go ..hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past Friday a co-worker came to me waving a sheaf of papers. &amp;ldquo;I did what you wanted. I put the orders in the system. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting a month and nothing (emphasized with the sheaf of papers) shows up on the computer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Nonplussed I asked &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this about?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(as if to a small child) &amp;ldquo;I take the sheets. I put the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/293/10/1197&#34;&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; in the computer and then I write &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner&#34;&gt;SCANNED&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; on the paper. Its not showing up!  This system doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at all!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at the desk and sure enough there&amp;rsquo;s a pile of papers, each with &amp;ldquo;SCANNED&amp;rdquo; written on the face.  (I did manage a straight face). &amp;ldquo; You really need to send them downstairs to BE scanned. Its a machine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this would be the end of it. Yesterday one of the other team members tells me she was button-holed on the stairs about why nothing is showing up yet in her orders when she did everything we&amp;rsquo;d asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; almost everything.  Technology advances.  People Stay the same (with apologies to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.creators.com/comics/rubes-about.html&#34;&gt;Leigh Rubin&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
