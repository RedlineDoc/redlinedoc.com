Why REDLINEDOC. Why not. Why flounder.

I hope my blog will answer those and many other questions.  I've started blogging in the past but the instruments were crude. I'm now much more up to speed and hopefully my wit and your braincells will not suffer the same fate.

I'm RedlineDoc because I redline hardware and software. I'm given a piece to test, and much like my father with boneless fish; he'd find the bone, I find the flaw.

I'm passionate about many things and hope that my thoughts will engender discussion, discourse, perhaps some rancor, maybe maybe some change.
